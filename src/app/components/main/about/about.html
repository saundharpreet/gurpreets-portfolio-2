    <p class="intro">
        Good question. I’m Gurpreet Kaur, a Ph.D. student in Animal Science.
        Basically, I spend my days obsessing over soil, microbes, and how to make forage crops happier and healthier.
        And yes, it is as nerdy and fascinating as it sounds.

    <p class="background">
        Originally from a small village in Punjab, India, I grew up around farms and dairy animals.
        My family’s love for gardening inspired me to dive deep into agriculture.
        Now I’m here in the US with the Nutrient Management Spear Program, trying to figure out how microbes can
        secretly save the world, one field at a time.

        When I’m not analyzing soil samples or pondering microbial mysteries, you might find me gardening, daydreaming
        about farms, or plotting how to turn every lawn into a thriving ecosystem.
        Want to talk soil, microbes, or just swap gardening tips? You’ve come to the right place.
